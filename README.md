This project was inspired by my group's project for EID101, where we explored ways to make pickup trucks more aerodynamic for the sake of improving fuel efficiency. Hence, the program graphs the sales of light trucks and average fuel consumption per vehicle from 1990-2019. It does so by collecting data from two different CSV files provided in this repo(sources below) and plotting them against time. The purpose is to show how the increasing sales of inefficient pickup trucks increases the average fuel consumption per vehicle in the United States.
